  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>

  <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe i finally got everything packed and ready to go. Beacuse i'm on a segway,i wasn't 
    able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone,ipod.digial camera,acd a protein bar.Just the essentials.As 
    Lao Tzu would habe asid,"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segwau."
